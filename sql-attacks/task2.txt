"bobnewpass"
alice
"name"="bob"
"company"="bobcomp4',pass=sha1('bobnewpass') WHERE name='bob' -- "
"email"="alice@hi.com"

"Company" was the only parameter in a function from class.user.php that contained an UPDATE SQL statement (besides the ones for the login from task 1) that had the mysql_real_escape_string commented out.
This provided the vulnerability for SQL injections, which is where I added in the hashed version of the password I wanted to set for Bob, ONLY WHERE name='bob' in the user table.
I added the email "alice@hi.com" to be able to edit the profile.
